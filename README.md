# NPWD Whos Calling? React Native Capstone
**A Capstone project built with React Native for Epicodus 06.24.18**

## By Bobby Martin

## Description
This project is built with React Native/Redux. It uses the Whitepages PRO Phone Reputation API to send GET requests for phone number reputation information. The user will then have the option to post that phone number to an open comment board to warn other users about a potential scam phone call threat

## Setup Requirements

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
* Run `brew install watchman` to add watchman support
* Open Xcode locally
* Run `npm start` to start the development server
* Type `i` to start iOS emulator in Xcode
**_If Expo doesn't open automatically on build_** execute the following
* Swipe right on the home screen
* Tap on the Expo App icon
* Type `i` in the terminal to start the dev environment again

## Notes

* Getting API key and doing research on API information.
* Sketching ideas for wireframes

## Capstone Proposal
**Name of Student**: Bobby Martin
**Name of Project**: NPWD(New Phone Who Dis?) AKA: Who’s Calling?
**Project’s Purpose or Goal**: To let the user enter a phone number and check what type of scam that caller is trying to persuade you with, whether that be tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc. Then let the user post a comment on a public forum with the number and what type of scam it is.
**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal**:
* The user submits a phone number
* Make a GET request to grab information based on the phone number provided
* Display that information in the UI
**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and yourlanguage) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

* React / React Native
* Firebase
**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**
